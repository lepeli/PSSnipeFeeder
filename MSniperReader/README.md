MSNIPER.COM website is down. Looks like a permament. So this module/worker doesn't do anything now. 

# Configuration

##config.json (copy an example file and edit the new file)

1. Adjust filters. The first filter from the list (per channe) , that is met  - wins

# Usage
````
cd MSniperReader
dotner restore 
dotnet run
````

>dotnet restore is needed only before 1st run

Enjoy!
